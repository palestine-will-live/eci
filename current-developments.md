## Strategic Implications for ECI

### Advantages
1. **Official validation:** EU institutional recognition that Article 2 violations merit review and confirm breach
2. **Qualified majority exists:** 17/27 support demonstrates threshold for ECI success
3. **Institutional precedent:** Assessment establishes comprehensive violation documentation for ECI use
4. **Civil society momentum:** Growing pressure for concrete action beyond consultations
5. **Legal foundation strengthened:** Official EU finding of Article 2 breach validates ECI premise

### Challenges
1. **Political fatigue:** Officials seeking excuses to avoid action despite documented violations
2. **Process delays:** Article 79 consultations could extend indefinitely
3. **Foreign policy framing:** Risk of unanimity requirements rather than QMV
4. **External events:** Regional conflicts providing diplomatic cover for inaction

### ECI Response Strategy
1. **Timing:** Launch while institutional momentum exists but before it dissipates
2. **Framing:** Emphasize commercial policy nature (Article 207 TFEU) vs foreign policy
3. **Documentation:** Leverage both institutional review findings and official assessment as evidence
4. **Public pressure:** Convert institutional acknowledgment into citizen demand for binding action
5. **Gap exploitation:** Emphasize that recognition exists but citizen mandate needed for implementation

## Next Institutional Milestones

- **Late June 2025:** Review findings presentation to Foreign Affairs Council
- **September 2025:** Potential Council decision on next steps
- **End 2025:** Article 79 consultation timeline (if initiated)
- **2026:** Possible suspension decision (if process advances)
