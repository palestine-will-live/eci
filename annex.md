# Annex on the Subject, Objectives and Background to the Initiative

## Legal Framework and Commercial Policy Basis

This ECI seeks temporary suspension of **trade provisions** of the [Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Israel](https://eeas.europa.eu/archives/delegations/israel/documents/eu_israel/asso_agree_en.pdf) based on material breach of Article 2 essential elements provision.

**Primary Legal Authority:**
- **[Article 207 TFEU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A12012E%2FTXT):** EU exclusive competence for Common Commercial Policy (qualified majority voting)
- **Vienna Convention Article 60:** Material breach entitles treaty suspension
- **Association Agreement Article 2:** Human rights as "essential element" conditioning trade benefits

## Material Breach Affecting Trade Relations

**Article 2 Violation:** Agreement conditions **preferential trade** on "respect for human rights and democratic principles" as "essential element."

**Commercial Impact:** Systematic breaches undermine conditions for preferential access, requiring proportionate commercial response.

**ICJ Measures:** Provisional measures (26/01/2024) found Genocide Convention violations plausible, creating obligations to employ available **trade instruments**.

**UN Determinations:** [Resolution 2334](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N16/463/27/PDF/N1646327.pdf) established violations affecting legitimate trade relations.

**Geneva Conventions:** Documented violations breach obligations integral to Agreement conditionality, including systematic targeting of protected persons - over 200 journalists killed, 11 foreign humanitarian workers killed by IDF operations, and diplomatic personnel shot at in Jenin.

## EU Commercial Policy Precedent

**Consistent Practice:** EU suspended **trade provisions** for essential elements violations:
- Belarus (2012): Trade benefits suspended under Commercial Policy
- Myanmar (1997-2013): Trade restrictions for violations
- GSP+ withdrawals: Trade preferences suspended

**Legal Doctrine:** EU implements trade conditionality through Commercial Policy instruments requiring only qualified majority per Article 207 TFEU.

## Economic and Commercial Context

**Trade Relationship:** EU-Israel trade â‚¬47.9 billion (2022), EU represents 28.8% of Israel's trade.

**Preferential Benefits:** Duty-free industrial access, reduced agricultural tariffs, origin cumulation - **advantages conditional on Article 2**.

**Commercial Measure:** Targets trade provisions within EU competence, maintaining humanitarian cooperation.

## Precise Suspension Conditions

Trade restoration upon verified compliance:

1. **Ceasefire:** UN Security Council verification with benchmarks
2. **Humanitarian:** Pre-October 2023 levels per OCHA (500 trucks daily)
3. **IHL:** ICRC Geneva Conventions verification
4. **Settlements:** Complete halt per OSCE/Resolution 2334
5. **Movement:** Restrictions removal per UN Special Rapporteur

**Verification:** International monitoring using quantitative metrics.

## Proportionality

**Limited Scope:** Only **trade provisions** suspended. Humanitarian, consular, civilian cooperation continues.

**Temporary Measure:** Time-limited with review mechanism ensuring proportionality.

**Clear Restoration:** Precise conditions using international standards.

## Legal Basis for Commercial Action

**Article 207 TFEU:** EU **exclusive competence** over Commercial Policy including trade suspension (qualified majority applies).

**Commercial Conditionality:** EU consistently applies human rights conditions to trade benefits through commercial instruments.

**Legal Obligations:** ICJ measures and Genocide Convention require States employ available instruments - **trade measures within EU competence**.

**Precedential Consistency:** Follows established practice conditioning trade access on essential elements compliance.

This constitutes proportionate **commercial policy response** to material breach of trade agreement conditionality, preserving restoration upon verified compliance.
