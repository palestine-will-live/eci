# Organisers 

From the [ECI registration committee page](https://register.eci.ec.europa.eu/organisers/#/wizard/committee): 

> Organisers must be EU citizens old enough to vote in elections to the European Parliament.
>Your group of organisers must be composed of at least 7 members residing in 7 different EU Member States.
>Members of the European Parliament cannot be among these 7 members. You and your substitute can come in addition to these 7 members, meaning that you can reside in the same country as one of the 7 members. You can therefore provide information on up to 9 members (please do so only if you are in such a situation - additional members have to be indicated below).
>Please enter the required data.
>
>Please consult the [privacy statement](https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/how-it-works/privacy-policy_en#) on how your personal data will be used.

We need a minimum of 7 organisers, but it makes sense to have one from each EU country, which makes 27 in total.
