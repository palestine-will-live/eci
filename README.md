# Suspend for Palestine ECI

This repository serves as a public draft of the "**Suspension of EU-Israel Association Agreement until Palestinian Rights Recognition and International Law Compliance**" [European Citizens' Initiative](https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/) (ECI). 

An ECI enables at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU member states to invite the [European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/) to propose legislation on matters where the EU has competence to legislate.

This **"Suspend for Palestine"** ECI calls for temporary suspension of the [Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Israel](https://eeas.europa.eu/archives/delegations/israel/documents/eu_israel/asso_agree_en.pdf) based on non-compliance with Article 2's human rights requirements. The ECI is currently under collaborative development.

## Key Documents

- [Draft Legal Act](https://github.com/palestine-will-live/eci/blob/main/legal-act/draft-legal-act.md)
- [Objectives](https://github.com/palestine-will-live/eci/blob/main/registration/objectives.md)
- [Annex - Subject, Objectives and Background](https://github.com/palestine-will-live/eci/blob/main/registration/annex.md)

**ECI Registration URL:** https://register.eci.ec.europa.eu/organisers/#/wizard/proposed

## Legal Framework

The suspension would remain until six cumulative conditions are met: (a) verifiable ceasefire maintained per [UN resolutions](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/resolutions-0); (b) full humanitarian access restored; (c) compliance with [international humanitarian law](https://www.icrc.org/en/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions) in Gaza, West Bank, and East Jerusalem; (d) progress toward Palestinian self-determination within pre-1967 territories; (e) cessation of settlement expansion per [UNSC Resolution 2334](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N16/463/27/PDF/N1646327.pdf); (f) restoration of Palestinian freedom of movement.

This measure aligns with EU foundational values under [TEU Articles 2 and 21](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A12012M%2FTXT), serving as a proportionate diplomatic tool while maintaining humanitarian cooperation and supporting meaningful peace processes.

## Implementation Path

For successful implementation, this ECI must gather a **minimum of 1 million statements of support** from EU citizens across **at least seven different member countries**. Once validated, the European Commission would be invited to propose the suspension measure.

The [Council](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/) would then decide using **Qualified Majority Voting (QMV)**, requiring at least **55% of EU member states** (currently 15 out of 27 countries) that represent **at least 65% of the EU's population**. This threshold appears achievable given growing European concern over the humanitarian situation and increasing support for accountability measures.

## Motivation

The suspension of the [EU-Israel Association Agreement](https://eeas.europa.eu/archives/delegations/israel/documents/eu_israel/asso_agree_en.pdf) could have significant impact in encouraging compliance with international law and supporting Palestinian rights. The structured ECI process provides a democratic pathway for European citizens to influence EU foreign policy on matters of fundamental human rights and international law compliance.
