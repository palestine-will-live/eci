# Suspend for Palestine ECI

This repository serves as a public draft of the "**Suspension of EU-Israel Association Agreement until Palestinian Rights Recognition and International Law Compliance**" ECI. ECI stands for European Citizens' Initiative. It enables at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU member states to invite the European Commission to propose legislation on matters where the EU has competence to legislate.

This **"Suspend for Palestine"** ECI calls for temporary suspension of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Israel based on non-compliance with Article 2's human rights requirements. The ECI is currently under collaborative development. Feel free to suggest improvements:

## Legal Framework

The suspension would remain until six cumulative conditions are met: (a) verifiable ceasefire maintained per UN resolutions; (b) full humanitarian access restored; (c) compliance with international humanitarian law in Gaza, West Bank, and East Jerusalem; (d) progress toward Palestinian self-determination within pre-1967 territories; (e) cessation of settlement expansion per UNSC Resolution 2334; (f) restoration of Palestinian freedom of movement.

This measure aligns with EU foundational values under TEU Articles 2 and 21, serving as a proportionate diplomatic tool while maintaining humanitarian cooperation and supporting meaningful peace processes.

## Implementation Path

For successful implementation, this ECI must gather a **minimum of 1 million statements of support** from EU citizens across **at least seven different member countries**. Once validated, the European Commission would be invited to propose the suspension measure.

The Council would then decide using **Qualified Majority Voting (QMV)**, requiring at least **55% of EU member states** (currently 15 out of 27 countries) that represent **at least 65% of the EU's population**. This threshold appears achievable given growing European concern over the humanitarian situation and increasing support for accountability measures.

## Motivation

The suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement could have significant impact in encouraging compliance with international law and supporting Palestinian rights. The structured ECI process provides a democratic pathway for European citizens to influence EU foreign policy on matters of fundamental human rights and international law compliance.
