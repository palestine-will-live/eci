# Suspend for Gaza ECI [![License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC_BY--NC--ND_4.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)

This repository serves as a public draft of the "Suspension of EU-Israel Association Agreement" ECI. ECI stands for **European Citizens' Initiative**. It enables at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU member states to invite the European Commission to propose legislation on matters where the EU has competence to legislate.

This **"Suspend for Gaza"** ECI (Suspension of EU-Israel Association Agreement) is currently under collaborative development. Feel free to suggest improvments:

- [Draft Legal Act](https://github.com/palestine-will-live/eci/blob/main/legal-act/draft-legal-act.md)
- [Objectives](https://github.com/palestine-will-live/eci/blob/main/registration/objectives.md)

ECI registration page URL: **https://register.eci.ec.europa.eu/organisers/#/wizard/proposed**

## Motivation

The suspension of the Israel-EU association agreement could have a significant impact in ending the current starvation of the Palestinian people. 

An ECI requires 1 million signatures from EU citizens, then *only* a qualified majority of EU member states. The objective seems to be achievable.

## Contribute

Anyone is invited to contribute to the ECI improvement in any possible way. [Julien BÃ©ranger](https://github.com/julienbrg) is maintaining this repository.
