# Suspend for Palestine ECI

This repository serves as a public draft of the "**Suspension of EU-Israel Association Agreement until International Law Compliance**" [European Citizens' Initiative](https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/) (ECI). 

An ECI enables at least one million EU citizens from at least seven different EU member states to invite the [European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/) to propose legislation on matters where the EU has competence to legislate.

This ECI calls for temporary suspension of the [Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Israel](https://eeas.europa.eu/archives/delegations/israel/documents/eu_israel/asso_agree_en.pdf) based on material breach of Article 2's essential elements provision requiring respect for human rights.

## Key Documents

- [Draft Legal Act](https://github.com/palestine-will-live/eci/blob/main/legal-act/draft-legal-act.md)
- [Objectives](https://github.com/palestine-will-live/eci/blob/main/registration/objectives.md)
- [Annex - Subject, Objectives and Background](https://github.com/palestine-will-live/eci/blob/main/registration/annex.md)

**ECI Registration URL:** https://register.eci.ec.europa.eu/organisers/#/wizard/proposed

## Legal Framework

**Primary Authority:** Article 60 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties permits suspension when one party materially breaches essential treaty provisions. Article 2 of the EU-Israel Association Agreement establishes respect for human rights as an "essential element" conditioning all Agreement provisions.

**Treaty Basis:** [TEU Articles 2 and 21](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A12012M%2FTXT) establish human rights as foundational EU values, while [TFEU Articles 206-207](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A12012E%2FTXT) provide common commercial policy competence.

**International Obligations:** ICJ provisional measures of 26 January 2024 create binding obligations under the Genocide Convention for third-party States to prevent genocide using available legal means.

**Established Precedent:** EU has suspended association agreements for essential elements violations (Belarus 2012, Myanmar 1997-2013), demonstrating consistent legal practice.

## Suspension Conditions

The suspension would remain until verified compliance with: (a) sustainable ceasefire per [UN Security Council resolutions](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/resolutions-0); (b) humanitarian access restoration per [international humanitarian law](https://www.icrc.org/en/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions); (c) compliance with Geneva Conventions in Occupied Palestinian Territory; (d) cessation of settlement expansion per [UNSC Resolution 2334](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N16/463/27/PDF/N1646327.pdf); (e) restoration of Palestinian freedom of movement per international humanitarian law.

## Implementation Path

**Qualified Majority Voting:** Following ECI validation with **1 million signatures** across **seven member states**, the [Council](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/) decides using **55% of member states** (15 out of 27) representing **65% of EU population**.

**Legal Basis:** Established treaty provisions and EU precedent provide clear authority for such measures when essential elements are systematically violated.

## Proportionality

The suspension maintains humanitarian cooperation, consular relations, and medical assistance while addressing systematic non-compliance with binding legal obligations. Clear restoration conditions ensure the measure serves as diplomatic instrument encouraging international law compliance.
