# Annex on the Subject, Objectives and Background to the Initiative

## Legal Framework and Treaty Basis

This European Citizens' Initiative seeks temporary suspension of the [Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Israel](https://eeas.europa.eu/archives/delegations/israel/documents/eu_israel/asso_agree_en.pdf) based on material breach of Article 2 essential elements provision.

**Primary Legal Authority:**
- **Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 60:** Material breach by one party entitles the other to suspend treaty operation
- **Association Agreement, Article 2:** Establishes respect for human rights as "essential element" conditioning all provisions
- **[TFEU Articles 206-207](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A12012E%2FTXT):** Common commercial policy competence
- **[TEU Articles 2, 21](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A12012M%2FTXT):** Foundational values and external action principles

## Material Breach of Essential Elements

**Article 2 Violation:** The Association Agreement explicitly conditions relations on "respect for human rights and democratic principles, which guides their internal and international policy and constitutes an essential element of this Agreement."

**International Court of Justice Determination:** ICJ provisional measures order of 26 January 2024 in South Africa v. Israel found allegations of Genocide Convention violations plausible, creating binding third-party State obligations to prevent genocide using available legal means.

**UN Security Council Findings:** [Resolution 2334 (2016)](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N16/463/27/PDF/N1646327.pdf) determined settlement activities constitute "flagrant violation of international law."

**Geneva Conventions Obligations:** Systematic violations of [international humanitarian law](https://www.icrc.org/en/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions) in Occupied Palestinian Territory documented by [UN agencies](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/resolutions-0) constitute breaches of binding legal obligations.

## Established EU Precedent

**Consistent Practice:** EU has suspended association agreements for essential elements violations:
- Belarus (2012): Human rights violations
- Myanmar (1997-2013): Democratic principles violations
- Various targeted sanctions for systematic breaches

**Legal Doctrine:** EU Common Approach on political clauses (2009) explicitly provides for suspension when essential elements are systematically violated.

## Economic Context

**Trade Relationship:** EU-Israel bilateral trade totaled â‚¬47.9 billion in 2022, representing 28.8% of Israel's merchandise trade, making EU Israel's largest trading partner.

**Association Benefits:** Agreement provides Israel preferential market access, reduced tariffs, participation in EU programs, and enhanced political dialogue.

## Suspension Conditions

Restoration of full Agreement application upon verified compliance with:

1. **Ceasefire Implementation:** Sustainable cessation of hostilities per [UN Security Council resolutions](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/resolutions-0)
2. **Humanitarian Access:** Full restoration per [international humanitarian law](https://www.icrc.org/en/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions)
3. **International Law Compliance:** Concrete compliance with Geneva Conventions in Occupied Palestinian Territory
4. **Settlement Cessation:** Complete halt per [UN Security Council Resolution 2334](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N16/463/27/PDF/N1646327.pdf)
5. **Freedom of Movement:** Restoration of Palestinian movement rights per international humanitarian law

## Proportionality and Safeguards

**Limited Scope:** Suspension excludes humanitarian cooperation, consular relations, medical assistance, and civilian protection programs.

**Temporary Nature:** Conditional suspension with clear restoration pathway upon compliance demonstration.

**Monitoring Framework:** Objective assessment by established international bodies ensures transparent evaluation of compliance progress.

## Legal Necessity

**Treaty Obligations:** EU bound by foundational values under TEU Articles 2 and 21 requiring consistent human rights promotion in external relations.

**International Law Compliance:** Genocide Convention obligations following ICJ provisional measures require EU to employ available legal means to prevent violations.

**Institutional Consistency:** Suspension maintains coherence with established EU practice of conditioning trade relationships on compliance with fundamental legal obligations.

**Precedential Authority:** Vienna Convention Article 60 provides clear legal basis for suspension when essential treaty elements are materially breached.

This measure serves as proportionate diplomatic instrument encouraging international law compliance while preserving possibility of full relationship restoration upon demonstrated adherence to binding legal obligations.
