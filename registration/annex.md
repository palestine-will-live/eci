# Annex on the Subject, Objectives and Background to the Initiative

## Subject and Legal Framework

This European Citizens' Initiative calls for the temporary suspension of the [Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Israel](https://eeas.europa.eu/archives/delegations/israel/documents/eu_israel/asso_agree_en.pdf) (Council Decision 2000/384/EC) based on systematic violations of Article 2, which establishes respect for human rights as an essential element of EU-Israel relations.

The legal foundation rests on the [Treaty on European Union](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A12012M%2FTXT) Articles 2 and 21, which establish human rights as foundational EU values and guiding principles for external action. The suspension mechanism derives from [Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A12012E%2FTXT) Articles 206-207 regarding common commercial policy, combined with established EU practice of conditional agreements.

## Background and Justification

The current humanitarian crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territory reflects a broader pattern of international law violations that fundamentally contradict the human rights conditionality embedded in EU association agreements. Extensive documentation by international organizations confirms:

**Humanitarian Law Violations:** Extensive civilian casualties, restrictions on humanitarian access, and collective punishment measures in Gaza violate Geneva Convention principles and international humanitarian law obligations. [Amnesty International (December 2024)](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/8668/2024/en/) and [Human Rights Watch (December 2024)](https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/12/19/extermination-and-acts-genocide/israel-deliberately-depriving-palestinians-gaza) document systematic violations. [UNRWA (June 2025)](https://www.unrwa.org/sites/default/files/content/resources/unrwa_gaza_sitrep_175_11_june_2025_eng.pdf) reports continuing humanitarian deterioration.

**Settlement Expansion:** Continued settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem directly contravenes [UN Security Council Resolution 2334 (2016)](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N16/463/27/PDF/N1646327.pdf) and constitutes illegal territorial acquisition under international law. [B'Tselem reports](https://www.btselem.org/publications), including [December 2024 documentation](https://www.btselem.org/publications/202412_unleashed), detail systematic expansion activities.

**Human Rights Restrictions:** Systematic limitations on Palestinian freedom of movement, access to resources, and basic services violate fundamental human rights standards. The [EU itself (November 2024)](https://static.blast-info.fr/attachments/stories/2025/LIdPURgnRrO9kPwKvLLJ2Q/attachment-Y2Rw_SL6RtWLaARzGNI87g.pdf) has documented these concerns in official assessments.

## Current Association Agreement Benefits

The [EU-Israel Association Agreement](https://eeas.europa.eu/archives/delegations/israel/documents/eu_israel/asso_agree_en.pdf) provides Israel with substantial advantages including free trade area status with elimination of customs duties, preferential market access for agricultural exports, gradual services liberalization, access to EU funding programs, scientific cooperation agreements, and enhanced political dialogue. These significant economic and diplomatic privileges come with explicit human rights obligations under Article 2.

## Objectives and Conditions

The initiative seeks temporary suspension until six cumulative conditions are met:

1. **Sustainable Ceasefire:** Verifiable cessation of hostilities maintained according to [UN Security Council resolutions](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/resolutions-0)
2. **Humanitarian Access:** Full restoration of aid delivery per [international humanitarian law](https://www.icrc.org/en/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions)
3. **International Law Compliance:** Concrete steps ensuring adherence to [Geneva Conventions](https://www.icrc.org/en/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions) in Gaza, West Bank, and East Jerusalem
4. **Self-Determination Progress:** Meaningful advancement toward Palestinian statehood within pre-1967 boundaries consistent with [UN General Assembly resolutions](https://www.un.org/unispal/documents/resolutions/)
5. **Settlement Cessation:** Complete halt to expansion activities per [UNSC Resolution 2334](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N16/463/27/PDF/N1646327.pdf)
6. **Freedom of Movement:** Restoration of Palestinian mobility rights under [international humanitarian law](https://www.icrc.org/en/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions)

## Proportionality and Safeguards

This measure represents a proportionate response that maintains humanitarian cooperation while addressing systematic non-compliance. The suspension preserves consular relations, medical cooperation, educational exchanges, and civilian protection programs. A mandatory two-year review ensures regular reassessment.

## Civil Society Support

Growing civil society momentum supports this approach, including initiatives like [Israeli Citizens for International Justice](https://israelicitizensforin.live-website.com/english/), demonstrating cross-community support for accountability measures that serve long-term peace and security interests.

## EU Legal Obligations

The EU's founding values require consistent human rights promotion in external relations. [Association agreements' conditionality mechanisms](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52001DC0252) exist precisely to ensure partner compliance with shared principles. The Commission possesses clear legal authority under existing Treaty provisions to propose such measures when fundamental human rights principles are systematically violated.
