# Objectives

We call on the European Commission to propose a legal act proposing the temporary suspension of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Israel (L 147/3 - 2000) based on its non-compliance with Article 2, which establishes respect for human rights principles as an essential element.

The proposed suspension would remain in effect until: (a) a verifiable ceasefire is implemented and maintained; (b) full humanitarian access is restored in accordance with international humanitarian law; and (c) concrete steps are taken to ensure compliance with international humanitarian law and human rights standards.

This measure aligns with the EU's legal obligation to ensure respect for human rights in its external relations. The suspension would serve as a diplomatic tool to protect civilian populations and restore compliance with international law, while maintaining humanitarian cooperation provisions.

The Commission has legal authority to propose such action under Articles 206-207 TFEU regarding common commercial policy, in conjunction with Article 2 of the Association Agreement.
