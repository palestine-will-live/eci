## Suspension of EU-Israel Association Agreement until Palestinian Rights Recognition and International Law Compliance

We call on the European Commission to propose temporary suspension of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Israel based on non-compliance with Article 2's human rights requirements.

The suspension would remain until: 

(a) verifiable ceasefire maintained per UN resolutions; 
(b) full humanitarian access restored; 
(c) compliance with international humanitarian law in Gaza, West Bank, and East Jerusalem; 
(d) progress toward Palestinian self-determination within pre-1967 territories; 
(e) cessation of settlement expansion per UNSC Resolution 2334; 
(f) restoration of Palestinian freedom of movement.

This aligns with EU foundational values under TEU Articles 2 and 21. The measure serves as proportionate diplomatic tool encouraging international law compliance while maintaining humanitarian cooperation and supporting meaningful peace process.

Legal authority: TFEU Articles 206-207 and Association Agreement Article 2.
